Assignment #: 2

Program due date: Thursday October 12th 

Handed in date:  Thursday October 12th

Source code file name(s):
MyLZW.java






Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?: Yes, no errors

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:







Additional comments to the grader:

For MYLZW in results.txt I forgot kb is 1024 bytes, so for the results for MYLZW, I multiplied bytes by 1000 to convert to kb. Same thing for mb except I used 1,000,000 bytes = 1mb. Compression Ratio will still be the same. 

This does not apply to Winzipâ€™s results
